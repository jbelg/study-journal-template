cd = change directory

Linux is probably easier to use than Windows & this class we’ll use mostly Linux comments

Shell scripts same things written in a terminal.

Whole point of shell scripts is don’t have to cut & paste.

(rf  ./docs DANGER don’t ever type)

Can read it but can’t execute it

1st word is the app written in computer

Only thing you need to run on your terminal is publish

Edit files from your computer

Your remote repository is called origin
